# HuskyCrates-Injection-Example
Injection example for HuskyCrates 2.0.0

With 2.0.0, I've added official support for injecting slots into crates. All you need to do is inject your slots during an event to make the magic happen.

Injection is rather experimental, and if your injection setup is unstable, it's likely that you might run into some rather tricky problems to fix. I've added a few error messages that should clear things up, but it really depends on the situation.

If you're having any trouble, stop by the support discord for HuskyCrates.
